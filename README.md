# HR-Management-Software-App
A HR Management Service System with a WCF Web Service and a Desktop Application which is communicating with the service. The database is a SQLite-DB.
At start of the program, the database will be created in the AppData-Folder (of course if not existing) and if there are already employees available, the will be listed in a data grid.
In this application, employees with there addresse(s) can be created, read, edited and removed.
The windows were created on base of the MVVM-Pattern (Model View View Model).
